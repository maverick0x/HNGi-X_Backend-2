# HNGi-X Backend 2

## Task
You are to build a simple REST API capable of CRUD operations on a "person" resource, interfacing with any database of your choice. Your API should dynamically handle parameters, such as adding or retrieving a person by name. Accompany the development with UML diagrams to represent your system's design and database structure.  Host your entire project on GitHub, and provide a well-structured documentation in the repository that outlines request/response formats, setup instructions, and sample API usage.

### Steps to run the server
To use the server you'll have to clone the repository and get your MONGO_URI
2. Create a free database on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/) 
3. Install all needed libraries using ```npm install```.
4. Use ```npm run dev``` to run in development mode.
5. Use ```npm start``` to run in production mode.
